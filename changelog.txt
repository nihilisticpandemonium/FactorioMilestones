Version: 1.3.14
Date: ????

  Changes:
    - Tweaks to IR3 preset (Added Heavy picket, graphene, and electrum. Replaced special projects pack end goal count with a technology milestone, since productivity in labs can actually make the required number of packs variable).
    - Tweaks to PyMods presets (Added Dig-o-saurus, Thikat, Caravan, and Oculus)
    - As usual you will need to refresh your milestone set yourself if you are already in the middle of a playthrough (Settings -> Switch to Empty -> Switch to the preset you want -> Confirm).

  Bugfixes:
    - Fix GUI sometimes being too wide for the screen when using Compact mode. (Again!)
    - Fix settings GUI "Add X" buttons states being wrong when changing preset.
    - Fix issue where technologies that end with a number (e.g. "Electronics 3") would be considered researched during backfilling even if they were not.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Date: 2022-12-26

    - Add presets for Industrial Revolution 3, with or without the "Special Projects" add-on.

Version: 1.3.12
Date: 2022-11-15

  Bugfixes:
    - Fix GUI sometimes being too wide for the screen when using Compact mode. 
      Also, the GUI will now try to fit within 90% of the screen width instead of trying to use as much of the screen as possible.

  Locale:
    - Locale updates for 1.3.10 strings.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.3.11
Date: 2022-11-09

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    - Update Nullius preset to account for boxed versions of milestones in the "Resources" group (ingots, processors, glass).
    - GUI improvements:
      - Milestones from different groups are now aligned properly.
      - Improved the look of the scroll bars that appear when using large milestones set.

      As usual you will need to refresh your milestone set yourself if you are already in the middle of a PyMods playthrough (Settings -> Switch to Empty -> Switch to the preset you want -> Confirm).
    - Add preset addon for Fluidic Power (Thanks to stringweasel)

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.3.8
Date: 2022-09-13

  Features:
    - Add beta support for item aliases. You can indicate to Milestones that an item is worth a certain amount of another item.
      - This is designed for Nullius's science, which can be created individually or as a "box" item worth several science packs. Up until now the Nullius milestones were not accurate because of these 2 ways to create science.
      - For now there is no way to create aliases via the settings GUI. You can modify aliases using the export/import feature.
    - Add mod setting to hide the "±Xm" estimations.

  Changes:
    - Update Nullius preset to use aliases for science boxes. If you are already using the Nullius preset, you can update it in the settings (Switch to "Empty" preset, switch back to "Nullius", confirm).

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.3.2
Date: 2022-06-30

    - Fix crash with mods that create items before the start of the game. 

  Locale:
    - Locale updates from Crowdin.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.3.0
Date: 2022-06-07

  Features:
    - Now requires Factorio 1.1.60 or above.
    - Greatly improved estimations accuracy when added to an existing game. Milestones can now use production statistics directly to backfill completed milestones.
      - Accuracy is greater for more recent completion times. Expect ±5 minutes for 50 hours games, ±25m for 250h, ±1h40 for 1000h.
      - Editing estimation ranges is now only available for inaccurate estimations (>1hour uncertainty), and now work by just typing the time instead of typing "x minutes ago". This makes more sense now that you won't have to copy values from production statistics.
      - In existing games: Leftover estimations will be replaced with the new more accurate estimations. Estimations that had already been edited with typed-in times won't be touched.
    - Add milestone groups. You can create arbitrary categories, and milestones will appear grouped under these categories.
      - You can switch back to the old chronological view with the new mod setting "List by group".
    - Add preset for 248k Mod (Thanks to PreLeyZero!)

  Changes:
    - Updated presets to use milestone groups. Existing games won't be updated unless you reload them from the preset.
    - Milestones settings can now only be changed by admins, instead of relying on "Mod Settings Changed" permissions. This seems to match with Factorio's own conditions on modifying Mod Settings.
    - Changing the settings in a multiplayer game will now indicate who did the change in the chat message.

  Bugfixes:
    - Fix crash when the GUI was cleared through another mod or command.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.2.0
Date: 2022-02-20

  Features:
    - Infinite Milestones: 
      You can now set a "next" value for a milestone. When that milestone is completed, a new milestone is automatically created at a higher count, depending on that "next" value. 
      Example: "1000 science packs, next: x10" would create "10000 science packs" when completed, then "100000 science packs", etc. You can also use "+" for adding instead of multiplying.
    - You can now export or import encoded milestone sets (for a shorter, but non-human-readable string).
    - New "Compact list" Player Mod Setting, removes the "Completed at:" labels from the main view. Defaults to off.

  Changes:
    - Change presets to use infinite milestones. Existing sets won't be updated unless you reload them from the preset.
